## What I learned

- `offsetWidth` to get an element's width
- When setting an elements style width using JS, you need to specify the unit as well!
- Using `element.style.backgroundColor = ""` will completely remove that style.
- When accessing style properties directly (for example, `e.target.style.opacity`), there are returned as strings; so when trying to do math on them they should first be converted to numbers. .
